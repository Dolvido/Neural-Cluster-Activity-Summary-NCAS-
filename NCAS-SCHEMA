### NCAS Schema

The NCAS schema is designed to encapsulate and summarize the activity within neuron clusters of neural networks. Below is the detailed schema definition, including all necessary fields and their types.

#### Root Object
The root object contains metadata about the NCAS format and an array of neuron clusters.

- **NCAS_version**: (string) The version of the NCAS format.
- **clusters**: (array) An array of neuron cluster objects.

#### Cluster Object
Each cluster object contains information about a specific neuron cluster.

- **cluster_id**: (string) A unique identifier for the neuron cluster.
- **cluster_type**: (string) The type of neurons in the cluster (e.g., "excitatory", "inhibitory").

##### Activity Metrics
The activity metrics object contains various metrics that summarize the activity of the neuron cluster.

- **activation_level**: (float) The average activation level of neurons in the cluster.
- **spike_rate**: (integer) The frequency of neuron firing within the cluster, measured in spikes per second.
- **signal_strength**: (float) The intensity of the signals transmitted by the cluster.

##### Temporal Dynamics
The temporal dynamics object captures the changes in activity metrics over time and the synchronization of neuron firing patterns.

- **time_series**: (array of float) A chronological sequence of activation levels over time.
- **phase_synchronization**: (float) The degree of synchronization in neuron firing patterns within the cluster.

##### Inter-Cluster Interactions
The inter-cluster interactions object describes the connections and influences between different neuron clusters.

- **connectivity_map**: (object) A map of connections between clusters, where keys are cluster IDs and values are connection strengths (float).
- **influence_score**: (object) A map of influence scores between clusters, where keys are cluster IDs and values are influence strengths (float).
