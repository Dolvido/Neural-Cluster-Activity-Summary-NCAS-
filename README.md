# Neural-Cluster-Activity-Summary-NCAS-
The Neural Cluster Activity Summary (NCAS) is a digital format for summarizing neuron cluster activities in neural networks. It captures activation levels, spike rates, signal strength, temporal dynamics, and inter-cluster interactions, providing a clear, concise overview for analysis and visualization.
