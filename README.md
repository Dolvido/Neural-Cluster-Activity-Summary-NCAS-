# Neural Cluster Activity Summary (NCAS)

## Overview
The Neural Cluster Activity Summary (NCAS) is a digital format designed to encapsulate and summarize the activity within neuron clusters of neural networks. NCAS aims to simplify the complex data generated by these networks, making it more accessible for analysis, visualization, and interpretation. The format captures essential metrics, temporal dynamics, and inter-cluster interactions, providing a comprehensive overview of neural activity.

## Key Features
- **Cluster Identification:** Unique identifiers and types for neuron clusters.
- **Activity Metrics:** Includes activation levels, spike rates, and signal strength.
- **Temporal Dynamics:** Time series data and phase synchronization within clusters.
- **Inter-Cluster Interactions:** Connectivity maps and influence scores between clusters.

## Data Structure

### Cluster Identification
- **Cluster ID:** Unique identifier for each neuron cluster.
- **Cluster Type:** Classification of neurons (e.g., excitatory, inhibitory).

### Activity Metrics
- **Activation Level:** Average activation level over a specified period.
- **Spike Rate:** Frequency of neuron firing within the cluster.
- **Signal Strength:** Intensity of the signals transmitted by the cluster.

### Temporal Dynamics
